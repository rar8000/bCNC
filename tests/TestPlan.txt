Test Plan Outline

  Test Files
     - New test files in tests/static folder
     - some files do not have Z position in gcode on purpose
     - "big" test files may lock zoom on import. Unlock by fit2screen or view change.
         the initial zoom it too large for scrollbars to handle.

   Test Sections:

     File
        Test loading and import of files
        Test process timeout for large files
           - gcode files have a separate timeout while reading the file, not yet supported for other formats
           - timeout for processing is supported for all formats
        Test setting timeouts dynamically. Change timeouts while processing or drawing occuring. 
        Files:  large_scene.nc         a moderately large scene
                pajara-boriqua*.nc     very large dither image files for testing timeouts
                dog-2.5H.gcode         Large Ender 3D printer file taken from thingiverse (thing:4671526)

     Canvas buttons
        overlap - enabled/active paths should be drawn over inactive/disabled
        Raise each element to the top of canvas (grid, margins, probe), refresh will lower again.
        test each button on ribbon
        test config button and options
            -- Advanced block color needs a restart to show/hide buttons (trim margins, filter inactive)
        test each view
        test shortcut keys
        test shift click. Shift-ctrl-click
        Files:  large_scene.nc         a moderately large scene
                pajara-boriqua*.nc     very large dither image files for testing timeouts
                oneline.nc             test edge case of one motion command
                twoline.nc             test edge case of two motion commands
                seed_*layer_color.nc   test overlap render. Printable on laser. No Z commands.
                tinystar20.nc          small gcode to import test. No Z commands.
                dog-2.5H.gcode         Ender 3D printer file taken from thingiverse (thing:4671526)
                big*.nc                test extreme zooms and work areas

     Editor (List)
        expand and enable should not change selection
           * Test with no selection
           * one selected
           * some selected
           * all selection
           * mix of full blocks and expanded selection
           ***Clicking too fast could cause unintented behavior.
        test reprocessing occurs when toggling or moving (up/down/invert) in the list
        test selecting on block name
        test shift click. Shift-ctrl-click
        test each button on ribbon
            - toggling no selection should not reprocess
            - test Recoloring
        Files: Seed_tile.nc   is the main test file

     CAM
        test Config->Canvas settings
            - ensure button allows canvas colors to be changed without restart
        test Config->Colors
            - ensure button allows canvas colors to be changed without restart
        test other CAM functions to ensure compatibility

     Control
        Test resume. Test Z value is preserved. Open file where 2nd block Z value depends on 1st block. resume on 2nd block
        Files:  seed_tile.nc                main test file to test job resume. 
                assorted_small.nc           test 3D resume of jobs
